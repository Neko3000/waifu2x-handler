# waifu2x-handler

##What is this
Base on the https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe<br>
This seems like a shell of the source application.

##What it can do
For I never saw any application can scale image with absolutely perfect quality like this before,<br>
Addtionally,I believe sometime the authors of video need handle amount of pictures even the sequence of pictures(for animation)<br>
I think a more effective application is should be considered.

##Why it so simple
Forgive me it's the first time I tried WPF Framework,I haven't could control everything well(before this I only could<br> develop Winform applications.
Also it seems too mess in project(of course I need learn arrange anything in solution next time<br>
But with my video edit experience and powerful WPF,<br>
It will be soon.<br>
